  abstract = {Heart rate data are often collected in human factors studies, including those into vehicle automation. Advances in open hardware platforms and off-the-shelf photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensors allow the non-intrusive collection of heart rate data at very low cost. However, the signal is not trivial to analyse, since the morphology of PPG waveforms differs from electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms and shows different noise patterns. Few validated open source available algorithms exist that handle PPG data well, as most of these algorithms are specifically designed for ECG data. In this paper we present the validation of a novel algorithm named HeartPy, useful for the analysis of heart rate data collected in noisy settings, such as when driving a car or when in a simulator. We benchmark the performance on two types of datasets and show that the developed algorithm performs well. Further research steps are discussed.},

  abstract = {Objective To evaluate the diagnostic performance of a deep learning system for automated detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) in photoplethysmographic (PPG) pulse waveforms.
Methods We trained a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to detect AF in 17 s PPG waveforms using a training data set of 149 048 PPG waveforms constructed from several publicly available PPG databases. The DCNN was validated using an independent test data set of 3039 smartphone-acquired PPG waveforms from adults at high risk of AF at a general outpatient clinic against ECG tracings reviewed by two cardiologists. Six established AF detectors based on handcrafted features were evaluated on the same test data set for performance comparison.
Results In the validation data set (3039 PPG waveforms) consisting of three sequential PPG waveforms from 1013 participants (mean (SD) age, 68.4 (12.2) years; 46.8\% men), the prevalence of AF was 2.8\%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the DCNN for AF detection was 0.997 (95\% CI 0.996 to 0.999) and was significantly higher than all the other AF detectors (AUC range: 0.924\textendash{}0.985). The sensitivity of the DCNN was 95.2\% (95\% CI 88.3\% to 98.7\%), specificity was 99.0\% (95\% CI 98.6\% to 99.3\%), positive predictive value (PPV) was 72.7\% (95\% CI 65.1\% to 79.3\%) and negative predictive value (NPV) was 99.9\% (95\% CI 99.7\% to 100\%) using a single 17 s PPG waveform. Using the three sequential PPG waveforms in combination ({$<$}1 min in total), the sensitivity was 100.0\% (95\% CI 87.7\% to 100\%), specificity was 99.6\% (95\% CI 99.0\% to 99.9\%), PPV was 87.5\% (95\% CI 72.5\% to 94.9\%) and NPV was 100\% (95\% CI 99.4\% to 100\%).
Conclusions In this evaluation of PPG waveforms from adults screened for AF in a real-world primary care setting, the DCNN had high sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for detecting AF, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods based on handcrafted features.},

Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the optimal filter and filter order to be used for PPG signal processing to make the systolic and diastolic waves more salient in the filtered PPG signal using the skewness quality index. Nine types of filters with 10 different orders were used to filter 219 (2.1s) short PPG signals. The signals were divided into three categories by PPG experts according to their noise levels: excellent, acceptable, or unfit. Results show that the Chebyshev II filter can improve the PPG signal quality more effectively than other types of filters and that the optimal order for the Chebyshev II filter is the 4th order.},

  abstract = {Fitness and health-care-oriented wearables and apps have been around for a couple of years and are still gaining momentum. Over time, they have begun to harness considerable computational power and to incorporate increasingly sophisticated sensors, eventually resulting in a blurring of the lines between consumer electronics and medical devices. While their benefits and potentials are undisputed, the overly optimistic appraisal commonly encountered in both mass media and academic literature does not adequately reflect unsolved problems and inherent limitations of these devices. This Article will argue that while these issues have long been known to the engineering community, their relevance and legal implications appear to have been grossly underestimated. January 2016 marked a turning point, as news of two class-action lawsuits filed against major manufacturer Fitbit brought widespread attention to accuracy, reliability, and safety concerns regarding these devices. This Article will provide a concise overview of optical heart rate monitoring technology, the current state of the art, and research trends. It will be argued that under real-world scenarios these apps and devices are currently inherently inaccurate and unreliable, with even greater problems on the horizon as the industry shifts towards areas such as heart rate variability monitoring or the detection of cardiac arrhythmias.

  abstract = {Pulse oximeters are monitors that noninvasively measure heart rate and blood oxygen saturation (SpO(2)). Unfortunately, pulse oximetry is prone to artifacts which negatively impact the accuracy of the measurement and can cause a significant number of false alarms. We have developed an algorithm to segment pulse oximetry signals into pulses and estimate the signal quality in real time. The algorithm iteratively calculates a signal quality index (SQI) ranging from 0 to 100. In the presence of artifacts and irregular signal morphology, the algorithm outputs a low SQI number. The pulse segmentation algorithm uses the derivative of the signal to find pulse slopes and an adaptive set of repeated Gaussian filters to select the correct slopes. Cross-correlation of consecutive pulse segments is used to estimate signal quality. Experimental results using two different benchmark data sets showed a good pulse detection rate with a sensitivity of 96.21\% and a positive predictive value of 99.22\%, which was equivalent to the available reference algorithm. The novel SQI algorithm was effective and produced significantly lower SQI values in the presence of artifacts compared to SQI values during clean signals. The SQI algorithm may help to guide untrained pulse oximeter users and also help in the design of advanced algorithms for generating smart alarms.},

  title = {Rhythm-Based Heartbeat Duration Normalization for Atrial Fibrillation Detection},
  volume = {72},
  issn = {0010-4825},
  abstract = {Background
Screening of atrial fibrillation (AF) for high-risk patients including all patients aged 65 years and older is important for prevention of risk of stroke. Different technologies such as modified blood pressure monitor, single lead ECG-based finger-probe, and smart phone using plethysmogram signal have been emerging for this purpose. All these technologies use irregularity of heartbeat duration as a feature for AF detection. We have investigated a normalization method of heartbeat duration for improved AF detection.
Method
AF is an arrhythmia in which heartbeat duration generally becomes irregularly irregular. From a window of heartbeat duration, we estimate the possible rhythm of the majority of heartbeats and normalize duration of all heartbeats in the window based on the rhythm so that we can measure the irregularity of heartbeats for both AF and non-AF rhythms in the same scale. Irregularity is measured by the entropy of distribution of the normalized duration. Then we classify a window of heartbeats as AF or non-AF by thresholding the measured irregularity. The effect of this normalization is evaluated by comparing AF detection performances using duration with the normalization, without normalization, and with other existing normalizations.
Results
Sensitivity and specificity of AF detection using normalized heartbeat duration were tested on two landmark databases available online and compared with results of other methods (with/without normalization) by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. ROC analysis showed that the normalization was able to improve the performance of AF detection and it was consistent for a wide range of sensitivity and specificity for use of different thresholds. Detection accuracy was also computed for equal rates of sensitivity and specificity for different methods. Using normalized heartbeat duration, we obtained 96.38\% accuracy which is more than 4\% improvement compared to AF detection without normalization.
Conclusions
The proposed normalization method was found useful for improving performance and robustness of AF detection. Incorporation of this method in a screening device could be crucial to reduce the risk of AF-related stroke. In general, the incorporation of the rhythm-based normalization in an AF detection method seems important for developing a robust AF screening device.},

  title = {Signal Processing Techniques for Cardiovascular Monitoring Applications Using Conventional and Video-Based Photoplethysmography},
  abstract = {Photoplethysmography (PPG)-based monitoring devices will probably play a decisive role in healthcare environment of the future, which will be preventive, predictive, personalized and participatory. Indeed, this optical technology presents several practical advantages over gold standard methods based on electrocardiography, because PPG wearable devices can be comfortably used for long-term continuous monitoring during daily life activities. Contactless video-based PPG technique, also known as imaging photoplethysmography (iPPG), has also attracted much attention recently. In that case, the cardiac pulse is remotely measured from the subtle skin color changes resulting from the blood circulation, using a simple video camera. PPG/iPPG have a lot of potential for a wide range of cardiovascular applications. Hence, there is a substantial need for signal processing techniques to explore these applications and to improve the reliability of the PPG/iPPG-based parameters. A part of the thesis is dedicated to the development of robust processing schemes to estimate heart rate from the PPG/iPPG signals. The proposed approaches were built on adaptive frequency tracking algorithms that were previously developed in our group. These tools, based on adaptive band-pass filters, provide instantaneous frequency estimates of the input signal(s) with a very low time delay, making them suitable for real-time applications. In case of conventional PPG, a prior adaptive noise cancellation step involving the use of accelerometer signals was also necessary to reconstruct clean PPG signals during the regions corrupted by motion artifacts. Regarding iPPG, after comparing different regions of interest on the subject face, we hypothesized that the simultaneous use of different iPPG signal derivation methods (i.e. methods to derive the iPPG time series from the pixel values of the consecutive frames) could be advantageous. Methods to assess signal quality online and to incorporate it into instantaneous frequency estimation were also examined and successfully applied to improve system reliability. This thesis also explored different innovative applications involving PPG/iPPG signals. The detection of atrial fibrillation was studied. Novel features derived directly from the PPG waveforms, designed to reflect the morphological changes observed during arrhythmic episodes, were proposed and proven to be successful for atrial fibrillation detection. Arrhythmia detection and robust heart rate estimation approaches were combined in another study aimed at reducing the number of false arrhythmia alarms in the intensive care unit by exploiting signals from independent sources, including PPG. Evaluation on a hidden dataset demonstrated that the number of false alarms was drastically reduced while almost no true alarm was suppressed. Finally, other aspects of the iPPG technology were examined, such as the measurement of pulse rate variability indexes from the iPPG signals and the estimation of respiratory rate from the iPPG interbeat intervals.},

  abstract = {A photoplethysmogram (PPG) is a noninvasive circulatory signal related to the pulsatile volume of blood in tissue and is typically collected by pulse oximeters. PPG signals collected via mobile devices are prone to artifacts that negatively impact measurement accuracy, which can lead to a significant number of misleading diagnoses. Given the rapidly increased use of mobile devices to collect PPG signals, developing an optimal signal quality index (SQI) is essential to classify the signal quality from these devices. Eight SQIs were developed and tested based on: perfusion, kurtosis, skewness, relative power, non-stationarity, zero crossing, entropy, and the matching of systolic wave detectors. Two independent annotators annotated all PPG data (106 recordings, 60 s each) and a third expert conducted the adjudication of differences. The independent annotators labeled each PPG signal with one of the following labels: excellent, acceptable or unfit for diagnosis. All indices were compared using Mahalanobis distance, linear discriminant analysis, quadratic discriminant analysis, and support vector machine with leave-one-out cross-validation. The skewness index outperformed the other seven indices in differentiating between excellent PPG and acceptable, acceptable combined with unfit, and unfit recordings, with overall     F 1     scores of 86.0\%, 87.2\%, and 79.1\%, respectively.},

In 1990, the estimated age-adjusted prevalence rates of AF (per 100,000 population) were 569{$\cdot$}5 in males [95\% uncertainty interval (UI), 532{$\cdot$}8\textendash{}612{$\cdot$}7] and 359{$\cdot$}9 in females (UI, 334{$\cdot$}7\textendash{}392{$\cdot$}6); the estimated age-adjusted incidence rates were 60{$\cdot$}7/100,000 person-years in males (UI, 49{$\cdot$}2\textendash{}78{$\cdot$}5) and 43{$\cdot$}8 in females (UI, 35{$\cdot$}9\textendash{}55{$\cdot$}0). In 2010 the prevalence rate increased to 596{$\cdot$}2 (UI, 558{$\cdot$}4\textendash{}636{$\cdot$}7) in males and 373{$\cdot$}1 (UI, 347{$\cdot$}9\textendash{}402{$\cdot$}2) in females; incidence rate increased to 77{$\cdot$}5 (UI, 65{$\cdot$}2\textendash{}95{$\cdot$}4) in males and 59{$\cdot$}5 (UI, 49{$\cdot$}9\textendash{}74{$\cdot$}9) in females. Mortality associated with AF was higher in females, and increased by 2-fold (UI, 2{$\cdot$}0\textendash{}2{$\cdot$}2) and 1{$\cdot$}9-fold (UI, 1{$\cdot$}8\textendash{}2{$\cdot$}0) in males and females, respectively, from 1990 to 2010.

Conclusions
These findings provide evidence of progressive increases in overall burden, incidence, prevalence and AF-associated mortality between 1990\textendash{}2010. Systematic, global surveillance of AF is required to better direct prevention and treatment strategies.},

Smartphone camera\textendash{}based photoplethysmographic (PPG) pulse waveform measurement discriminates between different heart rhythms, but its ability to diagnose AF in real-world situations has not been adequately investigated. We sought to assess the diagnostic performance of a standalone smartphone PPG application, Cardiio Rhythm, for AF screening in primary care setting.Methods and ResultsPatients with hypertension, with diabetes mellitus, and/or aged {$\geq$}65~years were recruited. A single-lead ECG was recorded by using the AliveCor heart monitor with tracings reviewed subsequently by 2 cardiologists to provide the reference standard. PPG measurements were performed by using the Cardiio Rhythm smartphone application. AF was diagnosed in 28 (2.76\%) of 1013 participants. The diagnostic sensitivity of the Cardiio Rhythm for AF detection was 92.9\% (95\% CI] 77\textendash{}99\%) and was higher than that of the AliveCor automated algorithm (71.4\% [95\% CI 51\textendash{}87\%]). The specificities of Cardiio Rhythm and the AliveCor automated algorithm were comparable (97.7\% [95\% CI: 97\textendash{}99\%] versus 99.4\% [95\% CI 99\textendash{}100\%]). The positive predictive value of the Cardiio Rhythm was lower than that of the AliveCor automated algorithm (53.1\% [95\% CI 38\textendash{}67\%] versus 76.9\% [95\% CI 56\textendash{}91\%]); both had a very high negative predictive value (99.8\% [95\% CI 99\textendash{}100\%] versus 99.2\% [95\% CI 98\textendash{}100\%]).ConclusionsThe Cardiio Rhythm smartphone PPG application provides an accurate and reliable means to detect AF in patients at risk of developing AF and has the potential to enable population-based screening for AF.},

  abstract = {Background
Filtering is a ubiquitous step in the preprocessing of electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data. Besides the intended effect of the attenuation of signal components considered as noise, filtering can also result in various unintended adverse filter effects (distortions such as smoothing) and filter artifacts.
Method
We give some practical guidelines for the evaluation of filter responses (impulse and frequency response) and the selection of filter types (high-pass/low-pass/band-pass/band-stop; finite/infinite impulse response, FIR/IIR) and filter parameters (cutoff frequencies, filter order and roll-off, ripple, delay and causality) to optimize signal-to-noise ratio and avoid or reduce signal distortions for selected electrophysiological applications.
Results
Various filter implementations in common electrophysiology software packages are introduced and discussed. Resulting filter responses are compared and evaluated.
Conclusion
We present strategies for recognizing common adverse filter effects and filter artifacts and demonstrate them in practical examples. Best practices and recommendations for the selection and reporting of filter parameters, limitations, and alternatives to filtering are discussed.},

  abstract = {Background: Mobile phone apps using photoplethysmography (PPG) technology through their built-in camera are becoming an attractive alternative for atrial fibrillation (AF) screening because of their low cost, convenience, and broad accessibility. However, some important questions concerning their diagnostic accuracy remain to be answered.
Objective: This study tested the diagnostic accuracy of the FibriCheck AF algorithm for the detection of AF on the basis of mobile phone PPG and single-lead electrocardiography (ECG) signals.
Methods: A convenience sample of patients aged 65 years and above, with or without a known history of AF, was recruited from 17 primary care facilities. Patients with an active pacemaker rhythm were excluded. A PPG signal was obtained with the rear camera of an iPhone 5S. Simultaneously, a single-lead ECG was registered using a dermal patch with a wireless connection to the same mobile phone. PPG and single-lead ECG signals were analyzed using the FibriCheck AF algorithm. At the same time, a 12-lead ECG was obtained and interpreted offline by independent cardiologists to determine the presence of AF.
Results: A total of 45.7\% (102/223) subjects were having AF. PPG signal quality was sufficient for analysis in 93\% and single-lead ECG quality was sufficient in 94\% of the participants. After removing insufficient quality measurements, the sensitivity and specificity were 96\% (95\% CI 89\%-99\%) and 97\% (95\% CI 91\%-99\%) for the PPG signal versus 95\% (95\% CI 88\%-98\%) and 97\% (95\% CI 91\%-99\%) for the single-lead ECG, respectively. False-positive results were mainly because of premature ectopic beats. PPG and single-lead ECG techniques yielded adequate signal quality in 196 subjects and a similar diagnosis in 98.0\% (192/196) subjects.
Conclusions: The FibriCheck AF algorithm can accurately detect AF on the basis of mobile phone PPG and single-lead ECG signals in a primary care convenience sample.},

  shorttitle = {Clinical {{Validation}} of {{Heart Rate Apps}}},
  abstract = {Background: Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a proven way to measure heart rate (HR). This technology is already available in smartphones, which allows measuring HR only by using the smartphone. Given the widespread availability of smartphones, this creates a scalable way to enable mobile HR monitoring. An essential precondition is that these technologies are as reliable and accurate as the current clinical (gold) standards. At this moment, there is no consensus on a gold standard method for the validation of HR apps. This results in different validation processes that do not always reflect the veracious outcome of comparison. Objective: The aim of this paper was to investigate and describe the necessary elements in validating and comparing HR apps versus standard technology. Methods: The FibriCheck (Qompium) app was used in two separate prospective nonrandomized studies. In the first study, the HR of the FibriCheck app was consecutively compared with 2 different Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared HR devices: the Nonin oximeter and the AliveCor Mobile ECG. In the second study, a next step in validation was performed by comparing the beat-to-beat intervals of the FibriCheck app to a synchronized ECG recording. Results: In the first study, the HR (BPM, beats per minute) of 88 random subjects consecutively measured with the 3 devices showed a correlation coefficient of .834 between FibriCheck and Nonin, .88 between FibriCheck and AliveCor, and .897 between Nonin and AliveCor. A single way analysis of variance (ANOVA; P=.61 was executed to test the hypothesis that there were no significant differences between the HRs as measured by the 3 devices. In the second study, 20,298 (ms) R-R intervals (RRI)\textendash{}peak-to-peak intervals (PPI) from 229 subjects were analyzed. This resulted in a positive correlation (rs=.993, root mean square deviation [RMSE]=23.04 ms, and normalized root mean square error [NRMSE]=0.012) between the PPI from FibriCheck and the RRI from the wearable ECG. There was no significant difference (P=.92) between these intervals. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the most suitable method for the validation of an HR app is a simultaneous measurement of the HR by the smartphone app and an ECG system, compared on the basis of beat-to-beat analysis. This approach could lead to more correct assessments of the accuracy of HR apps.  [JMIR Mhealth Uhealth 2017;5(8):e129]},

  abstract = {Approximately 10\% of ischemic strokes are associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) first diagnosed at the time of stroke. Detecting asymptomatic AF would provide an opportunity to prevent these strokes by instituting appropriate anticoagulation. The AF-SCREEN international collaboration was formed in September 2015 to promote discussion and research about AF screening as a strategy to reduce stroke and death and to provide advocacy for implementation of country-specific AF screening programs. During 2016, 60 expert members of AF-SCREEN, including physicians, nurses, allied health professionals, health economists, and patient advocates, were invited to prepare sections of a draft document. In August 2016, 51 members met in Rome to discuss the draft document and consider the key points arising from it using a Delphi process. These key points emphasize that screen-detected AF found at a single timepoint or by intermittent ECG recordings over 2 weeks is not a benign condition and, with additional stroke factors, carries sufficient risk of stroke to justify consideration of anticoagulation. With regard to the methods of mass screening, handheld ECG devices have the advantage of providing a verifiable ECG trace that guidelines require for AF diagnosis and would therefore be preferred as screening tools. Certain patient groups, such as those with recent embolic stroke of uncertain source (ESUS), require more intensive monitoring for AF. Settings for screening include various venues in both the community and the clinic, but they must be linked to a pathway for appropriate diagnosis and management for screening to be effective. It is recognized that health resources vary widely between countries and health systems, so the setting for AF screening should be both country- and health system-specific. Based on current knowledge, this white paper provides a strong case for AF screening now while recognizing that large randomized outcomes studies would be helpful to strengthen the evidence base.},

  abstract = {Background
Screening for atrial fibrillation (AF), a major risk factor for stroke that is on the rise in Africa, is becoming increasingly critical.
Objectives
This study sought to examine the feasibility of using mobile electrocardiogram (ECG) recording technology to detect AF.
Methods
In this prospective observational study, we used a mobile ECG recorder to screen 50 African adults (66\% women; mean age 54.3 {$\pm$} 20.5 years) attending Kijabe Hospital (Kijabe, Kenya). Five hospital health providers involved in this study's data collection process also completed a self-administered survey to obtain information on their access to the Internet and mobile devices, both factors necessary to implement ECG mobile technology. Outcome measures included feasibility (completion of the study and recruitment of the patients on the planned study time frame) and the yield of the screening by the mobile ECG technology (ability to detect previously undiagnosed AF).
Results
Patients were recruited in a 2-week period as planned; only 1 of the 51 patients approached refused to participate (98\% acceptance rate). All of the 50 patients who agreed to participate completed the test and produced readable ECGs (100\% study completion rate). ECG tracings of 4 of the 50 patients who completed the study showed AF (8\% AF yield), and none had been previously diagnosed with AF. When asked about continuous access to Internet and personal mobile devices, almost all of the health care providers surveyed answered affirmatively.
Conclusions
Using mobile ECG technology in screening for AF in low-resource settings is feasible, and can detect a significant proportion of AF cases that will otherwise go undiagnosed. Further study is needed to examine the cost-effectiveness of this approach for detection of AF and its effect on reducing the risk of stroke in developing countries.},

Numerical indices summarizing the variability of the series are calculated from the RR intervals series. These measures are easily implemented and have low computational cost. They are usually calculated over longer segments of data than frequency-domain methods, typically 24 h. However, they can be also estimated from smaller segments (typically 5 min) in order to compare different episodes. In this chapter, a review of time-domain measures and their calculation within RHRV will be shown.},

  shorttitle = {An Innovative Peak Detection Algorithm for Photoplethysmography Signals},
  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is twofold. The first purpose is to detect M-peaks from raw photoplethysmography (PPG) signals with no preprocessing method applied to the signals. The second purpose is to estimate heart rate variability (HRV) by finding the peaks in the PPG signal. HRV is a measure of the fluctuation of the time interval between heartbeats and is calculated based on time series between strokes derived from electrocardiogram (ECG), arterial pressure (AP), or PPG signals, separately. PPG is a method widely used to measure blood volume of tissue on the basis of blood volume change in every heartbeat. In the estimation of the HRV signal from the PPG signal, HRV is calculated by measuring the time intervals between the peak values in the PPG signal. In the present paper, a novel peak detection algorithm was developed for PPG signals. Finding peak values correctly from PPG signals, the HRV signal can be estimated. This peak detection algorithm has been called an adaptive segmentation method (ASM). In this method, the PPG signals are first separated into segments with sample sizes and then the peak points in these signals are detected by comparing with maximum points in these segments. To evaluate the estimated pulse rate and HRV signals from PPG, Poincare plots and time domain features including minimum, maximum, mean, mode, standard deviation, variance, skewness, and kurtosis values were used. Our experimental results demonstrated that ASM could be even used both in the estimation of HRV signals and to detect the peaks from raw and noisy PPG signals without a pre-processing method.},

  abstract = {Pulse oximeters are frequently used to provide real time measurements of heart rate and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2). SpO2 is calculated by taking the ratio of the AC to DC components of the photoplethysmograph (PPG) signal measured by the pulse oximeter. For accurate estimation of SpO2, the AC component needs to be extracted from the signal through signal processing, where accurate peak detection is a crucial, difficult element. This paper investigates the use of the wavelet transform for real time signal processing to detect peaks that could be unintentionally attenuated through more conventional filtering methods. Four mother wavelets (Daubechies 3, symlets 2, coiflets 3 and reverse biorthogonal 1.5) were tested against each other to determine the wavelet with the best representation of the PPG signal in a noisy environment (SNR of 6.44). The reverse biorthogonal (rbio1.5) mother wavelet was found to better represent the PPG signal with a specificity of 0.97 and a sensitivity of 0.97. Further research into the decomposition depth of the rbio1.5 wavelet resulted in an optimal depth of 3, with the 2nd and 3rd levels being used for reconstruction of the signal. Using a wavelet length of 128 samples resulted in a time delay of 2.56 seconds. This time delay is well within clinical requirements for near real-time-signal analysis involving these devices.},

  abstract = {The noninvasive peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) and the pulse rate can be extracted from photoplethysmography (PPG) signals. However, the accuracy of the extraction is directly affected by the quality of the signal obtained and the peak of the signal identified; therefore, a hybrid wavelet-based method is proposed in this study. Firstly, we suppressed the partial motion artifacts and corrected the baseline drift by using a wavelet method based on the principle of wavelet multiresolution. And then, we designed a quadratic spline wavelet modulus maximum algorithm to identify the PPG peaks automatically. To evaluate this hybrid method, a reflective pulse oximeter was used to acquire ten subjects' PPG signals under sitting, raising hand, and gently walking postures, and the peak recognition results on the raw signal and on the corrected signal were compared, respectively. The results showed that the hybrid method not only corrected the morphologies of the signal well but also optimized the peaks identification quality, subsequently elevating the measurement accuracy of SpO2 and the pulse rate. As a result, our hybrid wavelet-based method profoundly optimized the evaluation of respiratory function and heart rate variability analysis.},
